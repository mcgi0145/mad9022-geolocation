This geolocation website allows the user to track their position through the web browser _with their content ofcourse_.
The website takes googles apis and importants the longitude and latitude directly to the url in order to give the exact location of the user to the screen, along with a google map image of where they are.
###Instructions
1. Click this [link](http://mcgi0145.github.io/mad9022-geolocation/index.html)
2. Click the box that says **Allow** (This will get your coordinates).
3. Wait a few seconds for the browser to retreive your data
4. Watch as the image appears on your screen with the lat and long, and a picture with you in the center!
